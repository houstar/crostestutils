Recover DUTS is a Python Utility that runs on test images. It periodically runs
a set of hooks to ensure that we can correctly connect / recover a bricked DUT
without requiring manual recovery.

In order to add a hook, add an executable script in the hooks/ dir that ends with
.hook suffix. It can be written in anything that is executable by a test image --
Python, Dash script or a binary program.

Hooks that fail result in logs @ /var/log/recover_duts_log.

The init script for this tool is stored in platform/init.
