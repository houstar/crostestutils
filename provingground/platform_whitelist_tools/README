Scripts to update platform_ToolchainOptions whitelists.

Download all the debug files for all the platforms into a directory and run
"fetch_commons.py" against that directory to get a list of all the
files that are passing currently on multilple platforms.
This will generate files containing the files that need to be
removed from the list.

Run "fetch_commons.py" against multilple builds (atleast two).
Then compare the files generated for various builds using
"sort file1 file2 | uniq -d" to get a list of files which are common
accross all platforms and multiple builds.

Run remove_from_whitelist.py" to remove the now useless files from the
whitelists in platform_ToolchainOptions.
